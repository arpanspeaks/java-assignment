Create a class  BankAccount having the members as given below:
accNo	integer
custName string
accType string (indicates ‘Savings’ or ‘Current’)
balance float

Include the following methods in the BankAccount class:
void deposit(float amt);
void withdraw(float amt);
float getBalance();
 	
deposit(float amt) method allows you to credit an amount into the current balance. If amount is negative, throw an exception NegativeAmount to block the operation from being performed.

withdraw(float amt) method allows you to debit an amount from the current balance. Please ensure a minimum balance of Rs. 1000/- in the account for savings account and Rs. 5000/- for current account, else throw an exception InsufficientFunds and block the withdrawal operation. Also throw an exception NegativeAmount to block the operation from being performed if the amt parameter passed to this function is negative.

getBalance() method returns the current balance. If the current balance is below the minimum required balance, then throw an exception LowBalanceException accordingly.

Have constructor to which you will pass, accno, cust_name, acctype and initial balance. 
And check whether the balance is less than 1000 or not in case of savings account and less than 5000 in case of a current account. If so, then raise a LowBalanceException. 
In either case if the balance is negative then raise the NegativeAmount exception accordingly.	     

Create a class with following specifications.							
Class Emp									     
       	
empId		int     	           
empName	string       
designation	string	           
	basic 		double               
	hra	            double	readOnly

Methods
printDET()
		calculateHRA()
		printDET() methods will show details of the EMP. 			                  
calculateHRA() method will calculate HRA based on basic. 

There will 3 designations supported by the application.								
If designation  is “Manager”  - HRA will be 10% of BASIC
if designation  is “Officer”  - HRA will be 12% of BASIC
if category is “CLERK”  - HRA will be 5% of BASIC

 Have constructor to which you will pass, empId, designation, basic and price. 

And checks whether the BASIC is less than 500 or not. If it is less than 500 raise a custom Exception as given below

Create LowSalException class with proper user message to handle BASIC less than 500.
